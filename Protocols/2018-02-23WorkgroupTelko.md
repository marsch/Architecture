## OIH API
The OIH API is used by the connectors for connecting to the OIH. 
We agreed that the API will have a synchronous interaction style. This emphasizes the transaction approach for the ISV application with its connector.
Brainstorming for a possible protocol:
- JSON Api
- OData

## next steps

	- Microservices for usermanagement
- Igor:
	- Consultation with Selim about usermanagement
	- Preparation PoC
- Franz:
  - create swagger draft for OIH API
- all:
  - read about:
    - OData
    - HATEOS
    - swagger
