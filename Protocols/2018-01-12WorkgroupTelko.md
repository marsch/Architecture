- accepted

## Vorschlag Roadmap
Franz: A purely theoretical elaboration of conception and architecture is difficult for several reasons.
- the conception should include existing and still to be developed components provided by elastic.io for the OIH
- the design of sophisticated product capabilities with research character is made more difficult without testing and practical proof of individual components
This justifies the proposal to base the architecture roadmap strongly on a practical path of the OIH project in order to be able to validate and, if necessary, adapt parts of the concept.
