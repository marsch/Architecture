## Next Steps
As described in the issue regarding the [Description of Integration Framework Microservices](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Microservices/issues/5), the following tasks arise till the end of the year (latest 29th December 2017):

- [ ] Review Franz' base architecture description and provide feedback **Igor** till **22.12.2017**
- [ ] Update and finalize the architecture concept **Franz** till **22.12.2017**
- [ ] Link the current results within the [milestone.md](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Board/blob/master/Milestones.md) file **Philipp** till **22.12.2017**

For the 4 following tasks see [Description of Integration Framework Microservices](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Microservices/issues/5):
  - [ ] Provide a description on the interaction of the microservices **Igor** till **22.12.2017**
  - [ ] Provide descriptions of the microservices for which Elastic.io has the lead **Igor** till **22.12.2017**
  - [ ] Provide a description of the microservice _Integration Content Repository_ **Hansj√∂rg** till **22.12.2017**

For guidance for the descriptions of the microservices the already existing description of the [Identity Management](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Microservices/blob/master/SecureAccessControl/IdentityManagement.md) can be used.
