Support of event sequencing

# Status
proposed

# Context
Event sequencing means enforcing the sequence of events or messages to ensure that messages are process in order of arrival.
How is event sequencing supported in the OIH? 

# Alternatives

## Alternative no support
Event sequencing is not supported

### Decision
ND

### Consequences
Some ISV applications relies on an ordered flow of events. A strategy to implement an integration for those applications needs to be designed.

## Alternative event sequencing is supported
Event sequencing is supported. 
What elements can be configured with event sequencing?
Describe scope for which sequencing is enforced.
