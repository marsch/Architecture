# Roadmap

## POC 1 – point to point integration of ISV applications

- Buiness API is provided and maintained by ISV application owner or system integrator; It is not an OIH component
- Integration Node contains a minimum of one Integration flow, but can also contain more integration flows to allow communication
between additional ISV applications for different uses cases

POC1!

## POC 2 – point to point integration of ISV applications using Connectors

- Buiness API is provided and maintained by ISV application owner or system integrator; It is not an OIH component
- Integration Node contains a minimum of one Integration flow, but can also contain more integration flows to allow communication
between additional ISV applications for different uses cases
- Decoupling of ISV applications using Connectors
- Integration flow provides simple mapping & routing features between Connectors

## POC 3 – hub & spoke integration of ISV applications with MDM

- Buiness API is provided and maintained by ISV application owner or system integrator; It is not an OIH component
- Integration Node contains a minimum of one Integration flow, but can also contain more integration flows to allow communication
between additional ISV applications for different uses cases
- Decoupling of ISV applications using Connectors
- ISV specific connector component includes adapter and transformator modules to interact with the OIH Smart Data Framework
- Routing between OIH components is part of Integration Node deployment settings

## POC 4 – hub & spoke integration of ISV applications with MDM and Identity Management

- Buiness API is provided and maintained by ISV application owner or system integrator; It is not an OIH component
- Integration Node contains a minimum of one Integration flow, but can also contain more integration flows to allow communication
between additional ISV applications for different uses cases
- Decoupling of ISV applications using Connectors
- ISV specific connector component includes adapter and transformator modules to interact with the OIH Smart Data Framework
- Routing between OIH components is part of Integration Node deployment settings
- Identity management features allow secured transactions and processing of data

## POC 5 – hub & spoke integration of ISV applications with MDM, Identity Management and Integration Repository

- Buiness API is provided and maintained by ISV application owner or system integrator; It is not an OIH component
- Integration Node contains a minimum of one Integration flow, but can also contain more integration flows to allow communication
between additional ISV applications for different uses cases
- Decoupling of ISV applications using Connectors
- ISV specific connector component includes adapter and transformator modules to interact with the OIH Smart Data Framework
- Identity management features allow secured transactions and processing of data
- Integration repository allows central management including technical configuration of all Integration Nodes
