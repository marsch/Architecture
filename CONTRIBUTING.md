# Usefull backlog item (issue)

### Since we use an 'issue' on multi purpose, let's call generally it an **item**

> Please use the ZenHub [extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) with your browser and find some [help](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github) on how to format with markup.

## Definition of done ([DoD](https://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2017/05/definition-of-done-vs-user-stories-vs-acceptance-criteria.html#.Wd28ARO0PUI))
- Contribute in **English only** - incl. linked attachements
- **Assign** an issue to member(s) - at least to yourself
- Give an **Estimate** about the complexity of the item
- Add **Sub-task** to inform others about its progress
- Define **Acceptance criteria** derived from the user story

- Track **decisions** by referring issues and votes against
- Refer **dependencies** to the item

### If this 'item' fulfill the DoD, you can move it into the 'Backlog' lane.
