# Integration scenario with DataHub

## Overview

This document will summarize the design suggestion for [data synchronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_synchronization)
scenario using DataHub (aka. Smart Data Framework)

## Known limitations

Obviously this scenario is very limited and focused only on **data synchronization** which is only a subset of larger 
[**data integration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration), 
[**application integration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration) or 
[**system integration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration) therefore can not be used
as the use-case for describing all of the the OIH application scenarios.
