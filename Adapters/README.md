# Adaptor Documentation

If you are not familiar with adapters, the document `AdapterGuide.md` is
designed to be a starting point.  It explains the problems which an adapter must
solve and the recommended way of solving those problems.

There is an additional folder
[`AdapterChecklists`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Architecture/blob/master/adapters/AdapterChecklists)
which contains checklists which can be used to verify adapter completeness as
well as to identify the API provider requirements.

There is a document [`AdapterOperationTypes.md`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Architecture/blob/master/adapters/OpenQuestions.md) which lists the types of operations an adapter can perform as well as the related API functionality which must exist.

There is an additional document
[`OpenQuestions.md`](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/Architecture/blob/master/adapters/OpenQuestions.md)
which discusses potential shortcomings and enhancements to the current adapter
approach.
