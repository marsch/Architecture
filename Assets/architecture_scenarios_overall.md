It is possible that some of the ISVs immediately upgrade to the new version of the shared domain while others continue to use the previous version of the shared domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0       | 0       | 2       | 5       | 2        |                                                                                    |
